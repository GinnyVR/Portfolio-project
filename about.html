            <br>

            <strong>Cand.polyt. in Design & Innovation from DTU. </strong>
            <br>

            <p>Hi! I am a Design Engineer, holding a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Design & Innovation from the Technical University of Denmark. I am specialised towards development of both physical and digital product/service solutions. My Master’s thesis was written in collaboration with Herlev Hospital. The thesis dealt with optimisation of a hand-held fluid balance chart by introducing a safer and more time-efficient app solution. The project received positive feedback from nurses and doctors across Denmark.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Personally I am open, curious and proactive. I continuously seek to further develop my skillset and acquire new knowledge, which can be utilised in a professional or personal context e.g., learning spanish or making a webpage. I am an energetic team player who loves to work on diverse tasks, however especially on the tasks that demand innovative and strategic thinking. I am a quick learner and extremely efficient in acquainting myself with new systems, problems and tasks. I am always positive and thrive in environments with a good atmosphere. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Privately I am easy-going, cheerful and known for my bad jokes. In my free time I love playing piano and badminton, and I am quite a space nerd, who enjoys studying the planets with my telescope. When traveling, i am mostly in the water diving and snorkling, looking for sea-turtles.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am always curious to learn new skills and experience new things.</p>
